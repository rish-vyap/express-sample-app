/* 1.) "env" specifies the environments your code is designed to run in. Every environment brings with it a certain set of predefined global variables.
   2.) "extends" property in a configuration file enables you to extend the set of enabled rules from base configurations.
   3.) "parserOptions" is for specifying the ECMAScript version you want to use.
   4.) "rules" is where you can customize ESLint's behavior by enabling or disabling rules. The value of each rule can be one of these:
           "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
           "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
           "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code is 1 when triggered)
